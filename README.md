# Half Life 2: Interactive Fiction Edition
Half Life 2 reimagined as a traditional text adventure game (a la Zork)


## Building/Running
This project uses [Inform 6](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Inform6) to compile to a Z-Machine. You will also need Make.

To build the game, run `make`. It will compile it to `hl2.z5`, which can be run with any Z-machine compatible with version 5 of the Z-machine standard (such as [Frotz](https://davidgriffith.gitlab.io/frotz/)). You can also play it in your browser with [Parchment](https://iplayif.com/).
